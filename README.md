# Personal Investment Portfolio – Data & Direction (Start: May 2025)

This repository documents the real-life investment journey of a humanities graduate, religious community member, and someone currently preparing for a data analytics bootcamp.  
It combines learning, financial independence, and personal transformation through structure, data, and digital tools.

**Project Z** is short for the German *Projekt Zukunft* – a personal path toward freedom and future through data, learning and structure.

## 📘 About This Project

This project emerged during a period of transition – between a life of service in a religious order and the decision to become financially, professionally, and personally independent.

I am a member of a religious order. I am queer. And I am highly sensitive – a trait I long saw as a weakness, but which has turned out to be one of my greatest resources.  
For many years, I tried to reconcile identity and adaptation – often at the cost of my own truth.  
In April 2025, I decided I would no longer live that way.

I hold a Master’s degree in the humanities, with a focus on culture, language, and society. My academic and life experiences shape the way I view systems, narratives, and data.  
I live in exile, between spiritual tradition and secular identity. I come from a different cultural background, but I do not place that identity at the center of this work – I let the structure speak for itself.

In just one week, I built something I had never imagined possible:  
I opened my first personal bank account, signed up with two brokers, structured a functioning Excel-based portfolio, set up my first crypto wallet, tested various platforms, and became active on multiple digital art marketplaces.  
What was previously “not permitted” or “not envisioned” suddenly became real – through research, clarity, and digital learning.

I used all available tools to orient myself – including AI tools like ChatGPT. They helped me structure my thoughts but didn’t always provide correct information. I cross-checked, corrected, refined – and learned how essential critical thinking is, especially when working with digital tools.

My crypto activities are not about speculation. I use coins like Tezos to enter digital art communities, to explore aesthetic spaces in a digital world, and to collect beautiful, sometimes niche works. These are not “investments” in the financial sense, but part of a broader learning and curiosity process.

Starting in September 2025, I will begin an intensive data analytics bootcamp to deepen my technical knowledge and prepare for my professional future.  
This portfolio is my personal preparation – and my first real data project.

This is my first step toward financial and personal autonomy.  
It doesn’t just show numbers – it reflects decisions I’ve made myself.  
I learn, analyze, and document – with the goal of developing professionally and taking responsibility for my own life.

> I’ve learned more about myself in one week than in 37 years.  
> Whether it becomes a new life, I don’t know – but it is a new beginning.

## Notes & Structure

- **Savings plan structure was adjusted in June 2025 after an experimental first month.**
- **I chose Bitvavo, Scalable and Trade Republic for their low or no fee structures.**  
  Unused funds remain in the cash account to earn ~2.25% interest (as of May 2025).
- **Gold ETC was selected with a 1-year holding strategy for potential tax exemption.**
- **Crypto positions are long-term.**  
  No sales are planned before a 1-year holding period to avoid capital gains tax.  
  _(This tax rule applies under current German regulations. Tax-free settings are activated in all platforms.)_

## Tools & Approach
