### Tools and Methods

**Microsoft Excel**  
Used for data input, monthly tracking, and visualizations:
- Price updates (manually or semi-automatically)
- Summary statistics and change rates
- Consistent formatting with minimalistic color schemes

**Python (learning stage)**  
Currently used to automate single values (e.g. current prices with date/time).  
More automation (e.g. reward tracking, charts) is planned for the second project year.

**GitHub**  
Used for documentation, versioning, and public tracking.

**Data Sources**  
- Bitvavo (crypto purchases and rewards)
- Trade Republic (micro-investments in ETFs, stocks)
- Scalable Capital (monthly savings plans)
- Objkt.com (NFTs and art purchases)

### Personal Note

This is not only a technical project. It also reflects my path of building a self-determined and sustainable life — financially, professionally, and personally.

I used to believe that private matters had no place in a professional setting. But I changed my mind. In times when gender-neutral language is banned in some German states, when radical politicians attack queer communities, and when major tech companies support those ideologies, I believe that transparency is important.

I am not an activist, and I don’t identify as “left-wing” — but I do consider myself a liberal person. And as such, I feel responsible not to stay silent. My hypersensitivity, my queerness, and my past are part of who I am — and they belong here, too.

This project is one small attempt to make data personal — not to prove anything, but to stay visible.

### Outlook and Next Steps

- Monthly time series tracking (value, allocation, rebalancing)
- Basic Python scripts (data extraction, aggregation)
- Power BI dashboards (for selected KPIs)
- GitHub publishing (project updates, README versioning)

*This project marks the beginning of my journey into data analytics. It combines practical learning with real financial decisions — and reflects my way of taking back responsibility for my own future.*
