## Methods and Tools

**Microsoft Excel**  
Chosen for visual precision, clear structure, and full control without external templates

Used for:

- Automated calculations (e.g., invested vs. current value)  
- Charts with neutral color scheme  
- Monthly sheets for tracking time development

**GitHub**  
Platform for version control and structured documentation of project progress

**Data Collection Platforms**

- Scalable Capital (ETFs, stocks, savings plans)  
- Trade Republic (micro-investments)  
- Bitvavo (crypto, staking)  
- Wallets: Temple (XTZ), Phantom (SOL), Ledger (planned)  
- Price sources: Bitvavo, CoinMarketCap

I am currently learning Python (as of June 2025).  
Some elements like coin prices and timestamps are already automated.  
All other data is still being entered manually.

**Reflection and Support**

- Podcasts, expert blogs, personal research  
- AI support (e.g., via ChatGPT)

---

## Planned Expansions

- Monthly time series analysis (costs, value, allocation)  
- Technical implementation via Power BI or Python (pandas, matplotlib)  
- Rebalancing evaluation starting summer 2025  
- Development of interactive KPIs and dashboards

---

## Objectives

This project is a structured and honest entry into working with financial data.  
It is based on real decisions, real risk, and a clear learning goal.  
The Excel structure serves as a foundation for ongoing analysis, reflection, and technical growth.

### Special Thanks to ChatGPT ü§ñ

This entire project was designed and built by myself including all data, logic, visuals, and documentation.

However, when I started, I had zero knowledge and no teacher. I found online materials, later bought books, and used ChatGPT as my main guide. Whenever I got stuck, had a technical question, or couldn‚Äôt find an answer, I asked ChatGPT. It was like having a very patient (and sometimes very confused) teacher by my side. The bot guided me step by step, often helping me turn vague ideas into working formulas or showing me that the answer was just one click away.

Of course, ChatGPT is not perfect. It sometimes gave me wrong answers, made things unnecessarily complicated, or completely misunderstood what I meant. When that happened, I nearly went crazy.

üëâ Always double check important results especially when it comes to finances, taxes, Web3 technologies, or fee structures. The bot occasionally mentioned outrageous fees or gave outdated information. Always verify critical claims and ask: Where is this from?

In the end, though, it worked. The tool became part of my learning process, my structure, and sometimes even my therapy. Despite the misunderstandings, arguments, and false info, I will grow up and learn with AI.
